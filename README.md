# Hey Folks ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior CS student from Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©. I was already familiar with computers as I've been using editing software and Adobe products since middle school. Fast forward to now, I am happy with my choice and it's been an incredible 3-year journey into the realm of programming.

I started off with C and was able to create a command line game with AWSD key. In the second semester, I applied for the lab assistant position. During those times, I was able to learn more advanced programming languages such as Java, Python, ReactJS, SQL, and C++.

Currently, my focus is on Cloud Technology (AWS) and mobile programming (Android).

Outside coding, I like music ðŸŽµ. I play the violin, drums, keyboards, tenor horn, and have a basic understanding of many other instruments! Sometimes, I channel my creativity through learning and producing music in my spare time.
