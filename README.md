# Hey Folks 👋

I'm a junior CS student based in Indonesia 🇮🇩. My programming journey began when I entered college, a path I hadn't anticipated choosing for my major. However, I was already familiar with computers as I've been using editing software and Adobe products since middle school. Fast forward to now, I am happy with my choice and it's been an incredible 3-year journey into the realm of programming.

I started off with C, learning quite deep, and was able to create a command line game with AWSD key controls. Come my second semester, I entered the selection for a lab assistant position and was happy to be chosen. This opportunity led me to learn more advanced programming languages such as Java, Python, ReactJS, SQL, and C++.

Currently, my focus is honed on Cloud Technology (AWS) and mobile programming (Android and iOS).

Outside coding, I like music 🎵. I play the violin, drums, keyboards, tenor horn, and have a basic understanding of many other instruments! Sometimes, I channel my creativity through learning and producing music in my spare time.

Oh, and I can't forget my two adorable dogs, Snowhite and Snowblack; their fur colors indeed resonate with their names 🐾
