# Hey Folks 👋

I'm a junior CS student from Indonesia 🇮🇩.
I was already familiar with computers as I've been using editing software and Adobe products since middle school.

Currently, my focus is on Backend Development and Cloud Technology. In the spare time, I like to experiment with Android.

Outside coding, I like music 🎵. Sometimes, I channel my creativity through music.
